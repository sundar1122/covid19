Project Goals:
1. Visualize and clean Brazil's case data: extract features and split data into train and test groups
2. Project future case trends for Brazil's data only
3. Overlay data from other countries (ex. US, Italy) using time since "Day 0" to predict Brazil's cases based on world's trends
4. Categorize "level of response" of various countries (ex. South Korea v. US), apply the case growth and flattening rate from
these countries to Brazil's data and compare - gives insight into the future prospects of Brazil's cases under varying government 
prevention measures and responses
5.
