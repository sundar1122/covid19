easier way to change dates to date-time format using df.to_datetime()
moving avergaes are more accurate than rolling because moving averages take the mean of the values around a specified value 
rather than the whole preceding data set

error analysis: the most accurate model is the one that minimizes the sum of the square of errors

continuing analysis
-try the log transformation and carry out the whole prediction test + error analysis
-also try the cuberoot transformation along with the sqrt one and compare
-try the prediction for about 50 data points (majority of the data set)
-also: try the autoregressive prediction on the original data (without transforming/correcting for stationarity) - just see 
what happens

Neural Networks:
-coursera course: Stanford University: Andrew Ng
  -intro to machine learning course that explains logistic regression and neural networks well
  
Preparation:
-set up WhatsApp
-install keras : tools for doing neural networks

Next Meeting: Thursday 7-8 PM
