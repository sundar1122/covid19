connected GitHub and downloaded data set into shared project
visualized data in pandas dataframe
calculated new cases in each region per day - excel formulas and updated data

Next Steps:
do a regression analysis on the basic cases and deaths data to show how many cases/deaths accumulated over time: use data
up until May 6th as training data, and data points after May 6 as test predictive data
